# Requirement spesification

## Description

Application is intended for the use of an anonymous company that organizes investment events. 
It provides an interface for collecting and analyzing data that is most relevant to their core business.

For each event they can
- Record how many people demonstrated their interest towards participating in the event in social media
- How many people bought tickets to the event (and the ticket cost)
- How many participated in the event 
- How many of the participants opened an investment portfolio at the event 
etc.

With this information they can calculate event specific (and for example month specific) key figures that will help the company in data-driven future business planning.

## Users

Currently the application is intended only for the internal use within the company, so only one user role is required.
